## Adding pages

1. Create a folder for the name of the customer, without whitespaces.
2. Add the html file into the folder
3. `git add .` in the root folder to stage changes
4. `git commit -m "decription of what you did"` to commit the changes
5. `git push` to upload the changes

## How to access the URL

After push, your site is live at

`https://sania-zeus.github.io/zeus-report/<folder>/<filename>`

That's it.
